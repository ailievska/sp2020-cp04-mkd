              If you have a damaged tooth, one or more teeth taken out, or you are simply not satisfied with the appearance, colour or shape of your natural teeth, we can correct and improve your smile with the help of dental crowns, bridges and veneers.</br></br>

              In the case of partially damaged natural crown, where conservative fillings cannot rectify the issue, the use of dental crowns allows for rehabilitation of the appearance and function of the affected tooth. For patients who are missing one or multiple teeth, but have adjacent teeth bordering the empty space, the application of custom dental bridges is advised. </br></br>
              
              Dental bridges and crowns range from ceramic (porcelain), metal, combined, and zirconia crowns.

    When patients are missing number of teeth in the upper or lower jaw and lack a sufficient number of abutments (teeth used to support the bridge), when their order is incompatible to the natural placement of the teeth, or simply in the case of a need for a more financially feasible alternative for dental correction, complete or partial dentures can be an affordable and appropriate choice</br></br>

    For the construction of partial dentures, it is necessary that the patient has a few remaining natural teeth, to witch the dentures can be fixed with the help of hooks or attachments.</br></br>
    
    The construction of complete dentures is applied, when all of the patient’s teeth within the upper, lower or both jaws have been lost.

    Dental veneers are aesthetic solutions that allow for the correction of the shape, colour and improvement of the overall appearance of the teeth, thus giving our patients an aesthetically pleasing, Holliwood-style smile of their dreams, without substantial loss of the dental tissue.</br></br>

    Dental veneers are also used for the correction of gaps between two mostly frontal teeth ( Diastema mediana), thus avoiding unnecessary scraping of the teeth or construction of dental crowns.</br></br>
    
    Veneers made from dental porcelain are fabricated in a dental technician laboratory, and composite veneers can be directly built-up in the mouth in just one visit.

    Dental cleaning and polishing is a painless procedure which refers to the removal of tartar, pigments and stains from the teeth, with the use of ultrasound, specialized pastes and brushes. This procedure is recommended to be practiced at least twice a year, depending on the type of the saliva of the patient, the way oral hygiene is practiced, and the quantity of tea, coffee and cigarettes consumed by the patient.

<p class="mb-3 dental_scaling--text--paragraph">
  Dental scaling is a deep cleaning method for additional polishing of the teeth which have already been cleaned with an ultrasound. This is achieved with a dental scale which is using fine dental sand with different flavours, which leads to a meticulous finish and leaves the dental enamel brightened, shinier and healthier.</br></br>

  Given the expertise of Dr Josif in this area, we warmly recommend that patients looking for cleaning and whitening of their teeth, try dental scaling for best results.

  Tooth fillings are one of the most common procedures done when visiting a dentist. Most of us have at least one, if not multiple seals. Even though dental fillers fall under the category of general dentistry, we placed them here because in today’s modern dentistry, high level of aesthetics is the key to a holistic practise. Our fillers are perfectly constructed, thus blending seamlessly with the colour and texture of the natural teeth.</br></br>

  There are several types of fillers, but at our practice we use exclusively cosmetic (white) seals, imported by some of the world’s top manufacturers that guarantee the quality and duration of the material.

  We put extreme emphasis on our future – the children, and our dental practice has assigned space for socializing, advising and educating our youngest patients, as well as strategies for overcoming the fear of dentist and dental procedures. Children should beat this fear from their earliest age, and the dentist should strive to become their friend and a superhero who keeps their teeth healthy.

                The dental office “Mak Dental - Bitola” was officialy opened on 15.07.2019 in Bitola. Previously, in a period of two years, a complete adaptation and reconstruction of the office was made. Today, the office space is completely adapted and meets all the requerments from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of North Macedonia. The space itself is designed by the highest standards, with the possibility for enlargement of the clinic in the fields of dental prosthetics, dental implantology and dental radiology. We also use sofisticaded dental equipment and materials from renomated world manufacturers while providing our services to our patients. In our dental office, from the opening until today,  we’ve been providing our services to many satisfied patiens, most of them coming from the Pelagonia Region, as well as other parts of the country,  and patients from abroad who choosed us as providers of their oral health care for a reason.
